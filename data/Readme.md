## Data

### Coronaviridae description:
* __3168_desc.txt__ <br>
This file contained the description of 3168 Coronaviruses obtained from NCBI Virus including information about genome size, host, and isolation source. 

### Spacer level statistics:
* __40_corona.csv__ <br>
This file contains a similarity matrix for 3168 Coronavirus complete genomes. The first row and first column contain accession numbers of the viruses (the string length 40 used for constracted genome dictionaries is indicated in the first column of the first row). Each cell of the similarity matrix stores the number of distinct strings of length 40 in the overlap between virus i and virus j, where i and j represent row index and colum index respectively. The simmilarity matrix is symmetric.
